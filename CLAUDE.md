This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`SsmsQuickTools` is a VSIX extension for SQL Server Management Studio **22.6.0+**. SSMS 21+ is built on the
VS2022 shell and accepts `.vsix` installs, but Microsoft gives **no official support** for third-party
extensions there — an SSMS update can break this at any time. Full design rationale, risk analysis, and
milestone plan live in `docs/PLAN.md`; read it before touching `Ssms/` or `ScriptObject/`.

Features:
1. **Quick Connect** — a single "Quick Connections" toolbar combo that reconnects the active query window to
   a named server/database pair from a local `connections.json`.
2. **Grid → Script** — copies the active result grid as a self-contained `SELECT` script (CTE + `VALUES`) to
   the clipboard.
3. **Generar CREATE / Generar ALTER** — commands, exposed in the **Quick Tools** menu (SSMS main menu
   bar), that script the object under selection. SSMS's editor and result-grid context menus don't merge
   third-party VSCT groups, so all commands live in the Quick Tools menu instead — see `docs/PLAN.md`
   Milestone 5.
4. **Copy result as XML Spreadsheet** — copies the grid selection to the clipboard as an Excel-compatible
   XML Spreadsheet fragment, preserving type/precision.
5. **Auto Replacement** — expands a short token typed in the query editor into a configured SQL snippet
   when Enter is pressed, per `%APPDATA%\SsmsQuickTools\autoreplacement.xml`. The only feature that
   intercepts editor keystrokes — via `IVsTextView.AddCommandFilter` on `VSStd2K.RETURN`, not MEF (the
   project has none). See `docs/PLAN.md` Milestone 6.

## Build

Requires Visual Studio 2022 (17.14+) with the **Visual Studio extension development** workload, SSMS 22.6.0+
installed locally, and .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack.

```
msbuild SsmsQuickTools.sln -t:Restore
msbuild SsmsQuickTools.sln -t:Rebuild -p:Configuration=Release
```

Output VSIX: `SsmsQuickTools\bin\Release\net48\SsmsQuickTools.vsix` (or `bin\Debug\...` for Debug).

`SsmsQuickTools.csproj` is SDK-style (`Microsoft.NET.Sdk`) but needs `Microsoft.VsSDK.targets` for VSIX
packaging, which isn't auto-imported by `PackageReference` in SDK-style projects. The csproj therefore uses
explicit `<Import Project="Sdk.props" .../>` / `<Import Project="Sdk.targets" .../>` instead of the
`Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"` shorthand, with `Microsoft.VsSDK.targets` imported *after* `Sdk.targets` — it
depends on `$(IntermediateOutputPath)`, which only exists once `Sdk.targets` has run. If VSIX generation
silently stops (no `.vsix` in the output dir, no error), check this import order first.

Debugging: project properties → Debug → Start external program → `Ssms.exe`, argument `/rootsuffix Exp` if
the experimental hive exists. `StartProgram`/`StartArguments` are already set in the csproj to
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 22\Release\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe /rootsuffix Exp`.

Installed extensions live under `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\SSMS\<version_id>\Extensions\` — useful for
cleaning up broken installs.

## Tests

`SsmsQuickTools.Tests` is xUnit and covers only the pure-logic pieces that have no SSMS dependency:
`ValuesScriptBuilder` (type inference, escaping, VALUES batching), `ObjectNameParser` (name parsing),
`XmlSpreadsheetBuilder`, and `TokenScanner`/`SqlContextScanner`/`AutoReplacementExpander` (Auto
Replacement's token matching, string/comment detection, and cursor-marker logic).
Everything else (grid reading, SMO scripting, connection switching, the editor command filter) is
verified manually against a real SSMS instance — see the "Verificación" section of `docs/PLAN.md` for
the manual checklist.

```
dotnet test SsmsQuickTools.Tests
```

## Architecture

**`SsmsQuickToolsPackage`** (`AsyncPackage`) is the entry point. SSMS never has a solution open, so it
autoloads on `UICONTEXT.NoSolution` rather than any command-based trigger. `InitializeAsync` wires up
independent command groups, each self-registering against the shared `OleMenuCommandService`:
`QuickConnectCommands`, `ScriptDataCommand`, `ScriptObjectCommands`, `CopyXmlSpreadsheetCommand`,
`ExpandTokenCommand` — plus `AutoReplacementService`, which isn't a command but attaches the editor
command filter.

**`Ssms/SsmsHost.cs`** is the single access point to SSMS's internal, undocumented APIs
(`SQLEditors.dll` → `ServiceCache`/`IScriptFactory`, `SqlWorkbench.Interfaces.dll` → `UIConnectionInfo`).
All calls here are verified against SSMS 22.6.11806.211 specifically and are the most likely thing to break
on an SSMS update. Keep new SSMS-internals access funneled through this file rather than scattered across
features.

**`Ssms/IResultSetReader.cs`** defines the grid-reading abstraction with two implementations, used in
fallback order:
- `GridReader` — finds the active `GridControl` via `IVsMonitorSelection`/HWND walking (fragile bit,
  isolated on purpose), then reads data through the *public* `IGridControl` interface rather than internal
  reflection once the instance is found.
- `ClipboardTsvReader` — parses TSV from the clipboard (requires SSMS's "include column headers" option);
  used automatically if `GridReader` fails.

Both feed `TsvParser` and produce a `ResultSetData` (columns + string rows — no SQL types; typing happens
later).

**`Features/`** — one folder per feature, each independent of the others:
- `QuickConnect/` — `ConnectionCatalog` loads/watches `%APPDATA%\SsmsQuickTools\connections.json`, a flat
  list of named `{name, server, database}` entries (Windows-integrated auth only, no credentials in the
  file); `QuickConnectCommands` drives the single "Quick Connections" toolbar combo and reconnects the
  active query window via `SsmsHost` as soon as an entry is selected.
- `ScriptData/` — `ValuesScriptBuilder` is pure logic: per-column type inference over a fixed lattice
  (`bit → int → bigint → decimal → uniqueidentifier → datetime2 → nvarchar`, picking the most restrictive
  type that fits every non-null value in the column), quote escaping, and splitting into multiple
  `VALUES`/`UNION ALL` blocks past 1000 rows (a hard SQL Server `VALUES` limit). `ScriptDataCommand` wires
  `GridReader`/`ClipboardTsvReader` → `ValuesScriptBuilder` → clipboard.
- `ScriptObject/` — `ObjectNameParser` normalizes `[db].[schema].[obj]`/`schema.obj`/`obj` (pure logic).
  `ObjectScripter` scripts programmable objects (proc/view/function/trigger) via
  `OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID(...))` and tables via SMO `Scripter`; `CreateAlterRewriter` turns a CREATE
  script into ALTER by regex-replacing the first `CREATE` token (tables have no ALTER equivalent — that
  path is disabled for them). `ScriptObjectCommands` reads the selection/word-under-cursor and drives it.
- `CopyXmlSpreadsheet/` — `XmlSpreadsheetBuilder` builds an Excel-compatible XML Spreadsheet fragment
  from grid data; `ClipboardDataObject` is a hand-written COM `IDataObject` implementation used to put
  it on the clipboard alongside plain text.
- `AutoReplacement/` — `AutoReplacementCatalog` loads/watches
  `%APPDATA%\SsmsQuickTools\autoreplacement.xml` (`XDocument`, not `XmlSerializer`, so
  `<Replacement>` keeps its literal whitespace and no serialization assembly gets JIT-generated on
  first load) into `AutoReplacementEntry` records (one or more `<Token>` aliases per snippet).
  `TokenScanner` finds the token glued to the caret; `SqlContextScanner` is a one-pass T-SQL lexer
  that skips expansion inside string/bracket/quoted identifiers and `--`/`/* */` comments (nestable);
  `AutoReplacementExpander` applies `CursorPositionMarker`/`SelectReplacement`. `TextViewEditor` (in
  `Ssms/`, not `Features/`, since it's VS shell interop rather than an SSMS internal) holds the
  `IVsTextView`-level read/replace/caret-placement helpers. `AutoReplacementCommandFilter`
  (`IOleCommandTarget`, one per view) intercepts `VSStd2K.RETURN`; `AutoReplacementService`
  (`IVsTextManagerEvents`) attaches it to the active view and every view SSMS registers afterward,
  keyed in a `ConditionalWeakTable` so re-attachment is idempotent. `ExpandTokenCommand` is the same
  expansion logic exposed as a manual Quick Tools command + `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+5`, so the feature still works
  if the command-filter attach ever stops working on some future SSMS build.

## SSMS reference assemblies (`lib/ssms22.6/`)

Committed DLLs copied from a local SSMS 22.6 install (`Common7\IDE` and
`Common7\IDE\Extensions\Application`), referenced with `HintPath`, `Private=false`,
`SpecificVersion=false`. They exist only to compile against — not redistributed in the VSIX. See
`lib/ssms22.6/README.md` for exactly which types come from which DLL and why.

**Always reference the lowest supported SSMS version's DLLs (22.6.0), not whatever is installed locally.**
.NET Framework binds these by strong name; a reference built against a newer assembly won't load against an
older SSMS install. If the dev machine has a newer SSMS, copy that machine's 22.6.0 DLLs into
`lib/ssms22.6/` rather than referencing the live install directly.

`Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` is used instead of `System.Data.SqlClient` because the SMO assemblies
(`Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll` from SSMS 22.6) expect it.
